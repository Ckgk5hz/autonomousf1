# autonomousf1
An AI racing formula 1 racing car in the game F1 2020 based on the model AlexNet.
This program was made in python.

This project demonstrates the application of AI models in the game F1 2020 with the purpose of having autonomous racers in the racetrack. This is achieved by first creating training data by a human user playing the game, a combination of the region of the screen captured along with the keystrokes at the particular frame; then the training of the data using the model named as AlexNet and finally, testing of the model by letting the prediction analysis take over and give output keys to the system, allowing the program to essentially drive the car all by itself.
